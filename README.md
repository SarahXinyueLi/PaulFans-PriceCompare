Project Description: 

In this project, we aim to create a UI for price comparison, so that customers are able to choose targeted products at a relatively low price at proper time and proper shopping website. Each of us work on a certain online shopping website (Amazon, Walmart, Ebay and NewEgg) to get a specific products information (e.g. price, reviews, rating) through web scraping. After collecting data of a targeted product, we create a UI, which visualizes fluctuation and trend of product price with line graphs and displays other product information during the past few days on various shopping platforms. Moreover, we prepare a simulated database which contains relevant information of 10 speficic products to help users better understand and experience our program. 
 

Development Flow: 

1. Web scraping
Target: Information of M kinds of products on N online shopping platforms.
Frequency: Every six hours.
Data dimension: M Products * N Online platform *  T hours.

2. Data analytics
Ploting time-series information of the same product on each platform.
Showing the platform wtih the lowest price for the certain product.


Installation Instructions:

First, you need to clone the repo using the url we submitted.

Then import Python packages, including:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv
import time
from time import sleep
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


Run Instructions:

To start our program, you can first open and run the "scraping.py" file. After running this file, you will get a csv file showing information of 10 products from four online shopping websites at one point in time and you can get as many csv file as you want if you keep run the scraping.py file. To help you check our program, we proprepare the simulated database called "Database" that contains around 120 csv files dating from 11-01-2018. Then, you can find and run a py file named "Database and Plotting.py". This py file will aggregate all these 120 csv files into a whole database file, create the "database.csv" file, plot the trend of product price with line graphs from four shopping websites and displays other information at a certain time on certain day. Last but not least, you can open the "GUI" file and type in one of the names of 10 products, start date and end date. From our well-designed UI, you are able to see the price trend, link, comments and ratings of the product on four online shopping platform. Just take a look at this information and decide when and where to buy the product!
