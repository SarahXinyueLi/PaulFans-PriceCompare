Project Description: In this project, we aim to create a UI for price comparison, so that customers are able to choose targeted products at a relatively low price at proper time and proper shopping website. Each of us worked on a certain online shopping website (Amazon, Walmart, Ebay and NewEgg) to get a specific products information (e.g. price, reviews, rating) through web scraping. After collecting data of a targeted product, we created a UI, which visualizes fluctuation and trend of product price with line graphs and displays other product information during the past few days on various shopping platforms.
